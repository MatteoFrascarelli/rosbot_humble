    # Pause the program execution here, but any created thread/timer  
    # in the node will continue to be executed as well as the calling to any callback 
    # function defined for the node, allowing the node to communicate with other nodes.

    # kill the node, the spin function will exit, and any callback wonâ€™t be callable anymore.
